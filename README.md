# bubblesort

## description of algorithm

Its not a good idea to use this algorithm in most programming languages since there are predefined
functions that sort an array already. Just so I can know it exist I decided to learn it. A bubble sort algorithm is when you loop through every element in a array and compare it to the next element in the array. If it is bigger than the next one element in the array you, switch them around and you keep doing this until the array is sorted. for example in our array the first two aren't sorted so it moves the 6 number to the index of where the number 5 is and the 5 moves where the index of the number 6 is.
